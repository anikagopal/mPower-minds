		<p class="text_pos">Welcome to my website! My name is Anika Gopal and I am 14 years old. I live in Plano,Texas.My hobbies are playing tennis, drawing, dancing, coding, and many more things that fascinate me. I try to give my best in all the activities that I participate in. Moreover, I believe that all the activities require complete focus and dedication in order to gain knowledge and develop essential skills. I dislike or have fear of certain things like slimy creatures, cockroaches. But, my focus is also towards overcoming these fears.<br><br>
		I have a lot of belief in dreaming big and setting goals for myself. There are many things that I would like to achieve and do systematically in life. It includes taking care of my parents, sibling, and people around me. The most important thing is to dedicate myself to the service of others. There is nothing more satisfying than helping others. Therefore, I volunteer at and organization named Aceing Autism , a program for autistic children to grow from social connections through tennis. Apart from this, I am keen on learning new things each and every day. While learning, I pay attention to developing important skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, decision making, analytical and communication skills. Moreover, Iâ€™m very punctual and like to do things on time.<br><br>
		I am extremely friendly to all the people around me which makes me a happy person. There is a sense of happiness in spending time with friends. This also gives an opportunity to be part of their lives. We all hang out together for shopping, visiting restaurants and spending time outdoors walking and biking. Occasionally, we go for a picnic or tour with friends and family members. I am fortunate enough to see beautiful places and learn new things from there. Besides this, I like to do art and coding at home which helps to enhance my creativity and imagination in the technology world to do something better.</p></div>
